FIFA 2019 is the latest rendition from EA Sports of its massively popular FIFA series, a football simulation video game. It stimulates the games and tournaments tracks (English Premier League, UEFA Campions League etc.) that we tend to follow in the real world. There are several modes to choose from for instance, players could select the ‘career mode’, where one can choose to build a team from scratch, and they play games with their team with the aim of winning tournaments offered in the game. Win or lose video gamers get various opportunities to trade players and ultimately build a highly effective and winning team. As a football and video games enthusiast I’ve performed preliminary data analysis on the comprehensive FIFA 2019 players dataset available on Kaggle in order to gain insight on trends and patterns present in the dataset. 
This dataset comprises number of different attributes for around 18,207 players. Attributes include: basis statistics such as player name, club he is associated with, overall ratings, potential ratings, age, weight etc. as well as several player specific characteristics such as his market value, club wage, playing positions, skills such as movement, power and mentality.  Findings from this exploratory analysis would cater to the need of other video gamers, who flock to buy this game or sport journalists in their process of reviewing football clubs and players.
